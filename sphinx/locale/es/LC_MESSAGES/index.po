"**Smart-Choice** is a Python package for Decision-Making Analysis using "
"decision trees. **Smart-Choice** allows the user to define a decision "
"tree directly in Python. The best experience can be obtained when the "
"package is used in a notebook inside of Jupyter Lab or Google Colab. "
"**Smart-Choice** has no limits in the size of the decision tree created, "
"and it can efficiently run large trees. Different reports are available "
"to facilitate tree analysis."

"In the package, all model values and probabilities are entered directly "
"as node properties using typical data structures in Python. Thus, an user"
" with a basic knowledge of the programming language can use effectively "
"the package."

"For the terminal of end nodes, the user must supply Python functions to "
"evaluate the value of the node. This feature allows the user to use all "
"capacity of Python programming language. It is possibe to write functions"
" to run a complete Monte Carlo simulation using other packages as scipy. "
"In other scenarios, it is possible to build complex predictive models "
"that feed the decision model using, for example, scikit-learn. Other "
"great adventage of the **Smart-Choice** is velocity where it is compared "
"with spreadsheets; it is possible to run complex models in a fraction of "
"the time required when a spreadsheet is used."
